                <h5>Design Block</h5>
                <p>Sometimes... ok... oftentimes, I find myself hating everything I design. It's normal, and it's curable... eventually.</p>
                <p>When I face a really difficult design block, I find myself visiting the following sites to gather inspiration:</p>

            <h3>Now, design is a pretty subjective thing.</h3>
            <p>Beauty is in the eye of the beholder and all that. But there are certain techniques and methods that objectively make great design when it comes to web, so below are some tips and tricks to get you started.</p>
            <h3>White Space</h3>
            <p>Give your content and images room to breathe! Break things up and space them out. We aren't limited to 800x600 pixel screen resolutions anymore. According to <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_display.asp" title="Visit the W3Schools website for more information about resolutions and browser usage">W3Schools</a> over 97% of users today have screen resolutions over 1024x768 px. 35% are at 1366x768 and 18% are at 1920x1080. So don't force yourself to adhere to the tiny crammed spaces of yesterday. </p>

            <h3>Desktop, Tablet &amp; Mobile</h3>
            <p>As you are designing, keep in mind that users are looking at websites on a wide variety of devices, from their iPods, Phones, Tablets, Laptops and Desktops. Even on their television screens. So we want to be sure that we think about these different canvases while we figure out how everything will be displayed.</p>

            <h4>Mobile First!</h4>
            <p>Recently mobile devices bypassed traditional desktop usage for browsing the internet. So it's very important to ensure an excellent experience on mobile devices while users are on the go. So here's a list of tips for mobile design:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Put important information first - that means addresses, phone numbers, and links to purchase items.</li>
                <li>Do not add content to the initial landing page that isn't immediately important (remember your <a class="link" data-target="planning" data-section="design">business requirements!</a>), instead focus on those calls to action. However, always ensure that there is a way to access it on an interior page.</li>
                <li>Make the header and footer smaller. You're working with a very limited amount of space, you don't want to waste that valuable screen real estate with just branding and copyright info.</li>
                <li>Hide the menu, replace it with a button that says Menu and can be toggled on and off so the user can use it when they want and not have to scroll by it if they don't need it.</li>
                <li>Optimize your images, replace large images with small versions. Ensure that your site loads quickly because often mobile users are on slow connections!</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Calls to Action</h3>
            <p>Calls to action can greatly boost your conversion rates. Sometimes regular links are overlooked - but a call to action button that is very visible can entice users to click on the link and purchase your product/service.</p>

            <h3>Colors</h3>
            <p>Soften your text color, instead of straight black try a dark gray (such as #333-#444). While contrast is good, sometimes it can be too much. Black text on a stark white background can be hard on the eyes. Consider that the physical books we read are very rarely straight black on white. The pages are generally a softer tan and the ink is slightly faded. It gives a much more natural look.</p>
            <p>Avoid difficult to see color schemes, like yellow text on red or blue backgrounds. These color combinations are not only hard to read for the average user, but can also make it impossible to read for our color-blind visitors. Use colors that are complimentary on the color wheel. You can find great color schemes on <a href="color.adobe.com" title="Visit Adobe's website to browse color schemes.">Adobe Color CC (previously known as Kuler)</a></p>
